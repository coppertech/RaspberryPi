# rPi-Magic-Mirror

This is a pi project to create a magic mirror type display on a primary display (tv) shared with other AV equipment. The hope is to develop the project to determine when no other media is being used (via CEC) and switch the display to the magic mirror source, keeping they MM display until preempted by another video source.

Off/On automation on a schedule is a secondary item.
